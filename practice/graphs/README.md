## Intro
There is no limit to how many other verteces a vertex can connect to.
A vertex is called also a node. Vertex can have edges (also called connections).
Edges have costs (or weight).
Sometimes graphs have connections without arrows, this assumes the relation is bidirectional.
Trees are a form a graph.
A linked list is a form a tree, os it is a form of a graph.
